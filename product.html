   </p><p>   <strong>
Open Stone Asphalt</strong>
</p><p>

</p><p><strong>
Sand Asphalt</strong>
 </p><p>
A mixture of sand and bitumen which can be used as core material, filter layer or cover layer above or below water level. It is also an economic and efficient
method of providing EMERGENCY repairs when existing flood defences are breached.

ASPHALT & CONCRETE CRACK REPAIR SYSTEM
</h3><br><p><strong>
Permatrack - System 1</strong>
</p><p>
System 1 produces a permanent seal and bond for the more serious cracks in both asphalt and concrete surfaces.
</p><p>Designated cracks are typically cut out to a width of 200mm and a depth of 30mm. The channel being cleaned, dried and primed using Permatrack base material which penetrates, seals and bonds any underlying fractures.
</p><p>High PSV stone is then incorporated into the Permatrack base material and laid into the channel flush with the surface, again bonding and sealing the affected areas.
</p><p><strong>
Permatrack - System 2</strong>
</p><p>
System 2 is a simple, quick and effective system for over bonding and sealing cracks and joints in the road surface, whether it be concrete or asphalt, using a flexible high softening point material which penetrates into the crack as well as the channel. The area is prepared, cleaned, dried and filled flush to the road surface with Permatrack System 2 material.
